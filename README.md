# Fighting-18
Hello everyone! Welcome to the project folder of my game project "Fighting-18", this project provides installer and unzip package for free play, the current support system is only Windows, theoretically support Windows2000 and above x86 or x64 system. The game is compiled in a cold compiler language, Easy Language, and has not yet been perfected in details such as UI and sound effects, making it less playable. The game is still being compiled, and will be released when it is formally added to the player-versus-player functionality (currently, it can only be played in two-player mode on a single console).
